# TwitterOSINT for data leaks
A really janky Python script to scrape all tweets that day based on keyword search (default max: 1000) and filter using keywords such as "leak" or "breach".

If it finds any, a Windows notification will pop up showing the found tweets in a text file.
Does not use Twitter API as its no longer free.

I am no programmer, so its far from perfect. Bbut I use it everyday to monitor Twitter for possible leaks in my organization.
