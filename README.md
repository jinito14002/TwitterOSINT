# TwitterOSINT for tweets about data leaks
A really janky Python script to scrape all tweets that day based on keyword search and filter using keywords such as "leak" or "breach".  
(default max: 1000)   
If it finds any, a Windows notification will pop up showing the found tweets in a text file.  
Does not use Twitter API as its no longer free.  

I am no programmer, so its far from perfect. But I use it everyday to monitor Twitter for possible leaks in my organization.
